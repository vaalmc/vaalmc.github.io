The National Survey on Availability and Use of Information Technologies in Households (ENDUTIH) 2021, carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), in collaboration with the Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT), aims to obtain information on the availability and use of information and communication technologies in homes and their use by individuals six years of age or older in Mexico. The foregoing provides data to support decision-making in public policy matters. It also offers elements of analysis in national and international studies for users interested in the matter.<br>

ENDUTIH estimated that in 2021 there were 88.6 million Internet users, which represented 75.6% of the population aged six years or older. This figure revealed an increase of 4.1 percentage points compared to 2020 (71.5%).<br><br>
